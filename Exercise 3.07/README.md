# Exercise 3.07: Commitment

## Exercise description

Use Google Cloud SQL or Postgres with PersistentVolumeClaims in your project. Give a reasoning to which you chose in the README. There are no non-valid reasons, an excellent would be "because it sounded easier".

## Exercise realization

I would use Postgres with PersistentVolumeClaims because I already did, and it was quite simple for this case.
